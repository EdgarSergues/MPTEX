# Getting Started

You can install MPTEX using a special pip install command:

```
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ MPTEX
```

Installing your Package Locally:

You can also install your package locally (directly from your computer), using a special `pip install` command:

```
pip install --editable <PATH_TO_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY>
```

The --editable flag will install the package in "editable" mode, meaning that you can make changes to the package and they will be immediately available to the user.
