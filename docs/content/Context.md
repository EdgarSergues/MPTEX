# Context of MPTEX 

MPTEX allows the user to calculate the prospective life cycle inventory of direct air capture (DAC) systems for a specific year, between 2020 and 2050.

This new package would support the user to understand the environmental impact of a prospective DAC system in a temporal and spatial condition. First, it calculates the amount of energy produce via PV panels in a certain location, according to the .... Then, this is adapted within the grid mix in the selected location in the speifcic year. Next, the user will get ...

**Direct Air Capture (DAC) system inventory**

DAC is a product system (or technology) that takes in atmospheric air as an input and produces CO{sub}`2` as an output. The system typically uses CO{sub}`2`-absorbing chemicals, energy (heat), and electricity to remove CO{sub}`2` from the atmosphere. 


**Generating future Life Cycle Inventory (LCI):**

The prospective system inventory of the DAC system was estimated in two steps:
1. Energy consumption projection: We projected the expected reduction in energy and electricity consumption in the DAC system using technology learning curves. The learning rates were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, and in our case, we used a learning rate of 2.5%.

2. PV efficiency projection: We estimated the changes in the efficiency of PV based on the lifetime solar irradiation observed across geographies.
